# DE2-115 UNO Project

This project is an implementation of the popular card game UNO on the DE2-115 FPGA board. 

## Overview

The game is designed to be played on the DE2-115 FPGA board, utilizing its various features to provide a comprehensive and interactive gaming experience. The game logic is implemented in SystemVerilog.

## Features

- Full UNO game logic: The game follows the standard rules of UNO. Players can play cards matching the top card of the discard pile either by number, color, or symbol.
- Interactive user interface: The game interface is designed to be intuitive and user-friendly, making the game easy to play.
- Multiplayer support: The game supports multiple players, making it a fun and engaging activity for groups.

## Setup

To set up the game, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Compile the SystemVerilog files using your preferred FPGA development software.
3. Program the DE2-115 FPGA board with the compiled design.
4. Connect the necessary peripherals (e.g., display, input devices).
5. Power on the board and start playing!
